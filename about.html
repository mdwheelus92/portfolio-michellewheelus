          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Michelle, an aspiring front-end developer. I live in Mammoth
            Lakes CA, where I get to walk outside and instantly be in nature.
            Hiking, cross-country skiing, ice-skating and motorcycle riding are
            probably my favorite things to do in my free time. As much as I love
            to be in nature and take in what this world has to offer, I also
            love to create and add to it. I love writing songs, painting,
            blogging and crafting macrame. I even have my own small business
            named "Girl in the Meadows" where I sell my creations. Here I am
            now, attempting to add "coding" to my list of favorite things to do.
          </p>
          <h2>My Journey To Now</h2>
          <p>
            I've loved technology since I was a kid, and have always been
            interested in coding. It started when I was in highschool trying to
            create the perfect Myspace layout. The past few years I've wanted to
            make a change in careers and get into the tech industry but I only
            ever had experience in customer service. I applied to so many jobs
            that I didn't actually think I would love just because it was the
            experience I had. Until now. <br /><br />
            This year I finally took the step to apply myself and I signed up
            for the SheCodes Basics workshop. Immediately, I knew that this was
            what I wanted to do, and I haven't looked back. I love that coding
            is creative and logical. There are always multiple solutions, not
            just one. My mind loves learning new things, so what better career
            to have than one in technology where things are constantly evolving
            and there's a never-ending well of knowledge to be learne.
